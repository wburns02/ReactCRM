## Health Scoring Methodologies

### The Evolution of Health Scoring

Health scores have evolved from simple traffic-light systems to sophisticated predictive models incorporating machine learning, behavioral analytics, and real-time data streams.

> **Key Stat:** 84% of companies with formal customer success programs utilize health scoring as a cornerstone of their retention strategy (Gainsight).

### Building an Effective Health Score Model

#### Step 1: Reverse-Engineer Outcomes

The most accurate health scoring systems start by reverse-engineering outcomes:

1. Pull a list of all customers who churned in the last 6-12 months
2. Pull customers who renewed AND expanded in the same window
3. Look back 90, 180, and 270 days before the outcome
4. Identify behaviors that differentiated retained/expanded customers

#### Step 2: Select Meaningful Metrics

**Engagement Metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Weight Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| DAU/MAU Ratio | Daily to monthly active users | 20% |
| Feature Adoption | % of key features used | 15% |
| Login Frequency | Trend in user sessions | 15% |
| Time in Product | Duration of engagement | 10% |

**Relationship Metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Weight Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| NPS Response | Promoter/Passive/Detractor | 15% |
| Support Sentiment | Ticket tone analysis | 10% |
| Executive Engagement | Sponsor involvement | 10% |

**Financial Metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Weight Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Payment Timeliness | On-time payments | 5% |
| Contract Value Trend | Expansion/contraction | Varies |

#### Step 3: Avoid Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Measuring Activity, Not Intent**
> "When you pull the actual churn data and line it up against those scores from six months prior, the correlation falls apart. Accounts marked green churned. Red accounts renewed and expanded."

**Pitfall 2: Ignoring Indifference**
One company found their highest-risk accounts weren't those with low NPS scores. They were accounts where NPS scores stayed **flat across multiple surveys**. No improvement, no decline - just indifference.

**Pitfall 3: Static Scoring**
Health scores must evolve with customer behavior, product changes, and market dynamics.

### Health Score Framework

```
Score Range    │ Status    │ Action
───────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────────────────────
80-100         │ Healthy   │ Expansion focus, advocacy cultivation
60-79          │ Neutral   │ Engagement programs, value reinforcement
40-59          │ At Risk   │ Intervention playbooks, CSM outreach
0-39           │ Critical  │ Executive escalation, retention campaign
```

### Validation and Iteration

- Regularly compare predicted vs. actual outcomes
- A/B test scoring model changes
- Track false positives and false negatives
- Salesforce achieved **30% improvement in churn prediction accuracy** after implementing and validating their health score model

| HR/Back Office SaaS | 4.8% | High switching costs protect retention |
| Financial Technology | ~1% monthly (12% annual) | Strong for leading platforms |
| Healthcare SaaS | 7.5% | Significant challenges; 67% spike from 2024 |
| Education Technology | 9.6% | Highest B2B SaaS churn |

### Building Prediction Models

#### Data Requirements

```
Customer Data Layer:
├── Demographic Data
│   ├── Industry
│   ├── Company size
│   └── Geography
├── Behavioral Data
│   ├── Product usage logs
│   ├── Feature adoption
│   └── Session patterns
├── Relationship Data
│   ├── Support tickets
│   ├── NPS/CSAT responses
│   └── Meeting attendance
└── Financial Data
    ├── Payment history
    ├── Contract details
    └── Expansion/contraction
```

#### Model Types

1. **Rule-Based Models**
   - Simple threshold triggers
   - Good for starting point
   - Example: "Flag if logins drop 50% month-over-month"

2. **Statistical Models**
   - Logistic regression
   - Survival analysis
   - Cox proportional hazards

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Random forests
   - Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
   - Neural networks for complex patterns

4. **Ensemble Approaches**
   - Combining multiple models
   - Balancing precision and recall
   - Reducing false positives

### The Goal: Negative Churn

**Negative churn** occurs when revenue from existing customers (expansion, upsell) exceeds revenue lost to churn and contraction. This is the ultimate goal and signals a healthy, growing customer base.

#### Calculating CSAT
```
CSAT = (Number of Satisfied Responses / Total Responses) × 100
Satisfied = Ratings of 4-5 on a 5-point scale
```

### CES Benchmarks (2025)

#### Benchmark Scores
- **Average CES:** 5.99 (on 7-point scale)
- **Target:** 6+ for low-effort experiences

> **Key Insight:** A CEB study found improving CES from 1 to 5 increased loyalty by 22%. However, improving from 5 to 7 only increased loyalty by 2%. Focus on eliminating high-effort experiences.

#### Calculating CES
```
CES = Sum of All Ratings / Number of Responses
Scale: 1 (Very Difficult) to 7 (Very Easy)
```

### Metric Usage in B2B (2025)

| Metric | B2B Usage Rate |
|--------|----------------|
| NPS | 41% (most trusted) |
