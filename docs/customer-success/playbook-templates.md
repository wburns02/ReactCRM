   - Escalating is not a sign of failure

2. **Own the Communication**
   - Single point of contact for customer
   - Consistent updates at committed intervals
   - No surprises

3. **Focus on Resolution, Not Blame**
   - Customer doesn't care whose fault it is
   - Save blame discussions for internal post-mortem

4. **Document Everything**
   - Detailed timeline
   - All communications
   - Decisions made and rationale

5. **Follow Through on Prevention**
   - Action items from post-mortem must be completed
   - Update customer on preventive measures
