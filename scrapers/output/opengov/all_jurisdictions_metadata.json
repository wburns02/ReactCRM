Medical exceptions are usually sought after to take care of a loved one who may need assistance in day to day living.\n\nAll medical exception requests for zoned areas are required to be reviewed by the Anderson County Board of Zoning Appeals at a regularly scheduled public hearing. Is is strongly encouraged for all applicants to attend the public hearing in which their medical exception application is reviewed.

The law requires that at least 20%-25% of units in a development have long-term affordability restrictions. Under Chapter 40B, the local Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is the permit granting authority. The ZBA must review and make decisions (approve, approve with conditions, or deny comprehensive permits) in a public hearing setting.\n\nA prerequisite to filing with the ZBA for a comprehensive permit is the issuance of a Project Eligibility Letter from a subsidizing agency.

The law requires that at least 20%-25% of units in a development have long-term affordability restrictions. Under Chapter 40B, the local Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is the permit granting authority. The ZBA must review and make decisions (approve, approve with conditions, or deny comprehensive permits) in a public hearing setting.\n\nA prerequisite to filing with the ZBA for a comprehensive permit is the issuance of a Project Eligibility Letter from a subsidizing agency.  The Sponsor has submitted an application for project eligibility to the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (the Subsidizing agency). A Zoning Review Memorandum is also required prior to submittal of a Comprehensive Permit. ",

        "description": "Any construction, grading, improvements, such as but not limited to fences, patios, sheds, decks, pools, tile installations, sump pump re-routes, etc. within the drainage swale or drainage easement require this type of permit authorization from the Public Works Department.  In addition, a parallel construction permit is required by the Departments of Planning and Permitting and Inspections for Decks, Pools/Spas, Building Additions, Screened-in Porches, and Accessory Structures or Sheds.  Please contact those Departments at 317-595-3120.  THIS PERMIT IS TO BE COMPLETED BY THE CONTRACTOR.           Permit Requirements:      1. Extent of easement encroachment:      a.  Minimum of 10 feet of easement width must be provided for storm sewer maintenance access and drainage flow behind easement construction.      b. If the drainage easement is shared by two properties behind or beside one another, at least 5 feet of easement or drainage swale width must be provided on each property.      c. The 10 feet easement access width minimum is intended for fences, small sheds, and minor landscaping that may be more easily removed if more width is required. Decks, patios, pool patios, etc. that are inherently more difficult to remove, may have a larger easement restriction requirement based on the case review and the overall easement width.      d. Decks cannot be attached to the home if they are permitted to encroach within the easement.      e. Decks, patios, etc. with proposed permanent roof structures cannot be attached to the home or have any supportive member of the roof structure within the drainage easement.           2. If storm pipe or drains exist within the easement, the 10 feet gap requirement should be divided equally with a 5 feet gap on both sides of the pipe/structure.          3. Existing condition of the swale/easement:  a.

To assist applicants when filing a Unified Solar Permit Application, we are sharing this checklist.  Note that requirements to qualify for review as a Unified Solar Permit application as noted on the USP applications remain in place and this checklist is only to be used as a guideline in addition to the application to aid the applicant by clearly detailing what our Plan Examiners will be looking for in the filing documents.  This checklist is unique to this City and was developed based on previous inadequate/incomplete USP applications filed since we launched the USP process in April 2024.\nThis City has the following challenges which has generated the need of these checklist to help mitigate issues due to the following:\n1.\\tAn older housing stock which has properties that might require:\na.\\tAdditional structural roof support that may be required for any additional dead load added to it.\nb.\\tRoofing materials and/or application that may need to be repaired or replaced to accommodate these types of installations.\nc.\\tOutdated and insufficient electrical power source and wiring which need to be upgraded to safely handle the requirements of these types of installations.\nd.\\tGenerally, the houses in this city were built in close adjacency to neighboring houses so there is more of a threat for the spread of a fire.\n2.\\tA history of a high rate of residential fires resulting in our fire department requiring the following:\na.\\tA clear and direct roof access path to the properties for firefighting.\nb.\\tRoofs that with this additional dead load added is still structurally capable of supporting the live load of firefighters/first responders when fighting fires.\nc.\\tUpgrading of electrical systems associated with these types of installations that can accommodate them safely.\nThe MV Building Department and Fire Department is supportive of the benefits to the environment and the energy savings of its residents installing solar panels and believes these guidelines will achieve this and at the same time if met they will keep our residents and our first responders safe.  \n\nPlease note:\n\nThe plans for this application will be reviewed by the third-party plans examiner company, Labella, and the Fire Department. Once both reviews are approved, a Building Department inspector will conduct an initial inspection to verify the site conditions.\n\nAfter the plans are approved and the initial inspection is passed, the permit will be issued.\n\nDo not begin any work before receiving the official permit and signed, approved plans from the Department of Buildings. Performing work without a permit will result in a Stop Work Order and a violation being issued.\n",

This plat should clearly indicate the street, alley, or easement to be vacated and include legal descriptions.\nThe petition for vacation requires signatures from all property owners that abut the area proposed for vacation.\nIf all abutting property owner signatures are not obtained, a Public Notice of Consideration to Vacate must be advertised in a local newspaper for four consecutive weeks. The petitioner is responsible for the advertising costs.\n\n2. City Review and Council Approval:\n\nThe Planning & Zoning Commission (PZC) will review the vacation plat and make a recommendation to City Council.\nCity Council will then consider legislation regarding the vacation, which requires three separate readings.\nA public meeting will be scheduled to allow anyone to address the Council regarding the proposed vacation.\n\n3. Utility Easements:\n\nIf a street, alley, or public highway is vacated or narrowed, affected railroads or public utilities may retain permanent easements for their facilities if the City determines relocation is unnecessary. This ensures the continued maintenance, operation, and access to these utilities.\n\n4. Plat Recording:\n\nFollowing City Council approval, the original tracing/mylar of the plat, along with three signed prints, will be returned to the petitioner.\nThe petitioner is then responsible for filing the approved vacation plat with the Summit County Recorder within 60 days.\nFailure to record the plat within this timeframe will result in the approval being voided.\n\n5. Final Submission:\n\nWithin five working days of recording the plat, the petitioner must furnish the Department of Planning & Zoning with the original tracing/mylar of the plat and a digital copy in a format acceptable to the City.",

The ADU may take various forms (i.e., a detached unit, a unit within an accessory structure such as a detached garage, or a unit that is part of an expanded or remodeled primary dwelling).\n\n1.Per RIGL 45-24-37(e) an ADU is permitted as-of-right in all residential zoning districts, in each of the following circumstances.\n\nA.One accessory dwelling unit (\"ADU\") is permitted on residential property, in either an existing remodeled primary structure, as an addition to an existing primary structure, or within a new primary structure. \n\nB.One accessory dwelling unit (ADU) is permitted within the existing footprint of an existing detached accessory structure, provided the ADU does not expand the footprint of the structure.\n\nC.One accessory dwelling unit (ADU) in a new development or a new structure is permitted by right on a residential lot with a total area of twenty thousand square feet (20,000 sq. ft.). If such ADU is part of an inclusionary zoning or comprehensive permit application, it may be restricted to affordable housing. See Section 260-50.\n\n2.Tenants of an ADU are not restricted based on familial relationships or age unless required by the terms of a federal, state, or municipal subsidy related to affordability.\n\n3.Private restrictions on ADUs imposed by condominium associations, homeowner associations, or similar residential property governing bodies, which conflict with the provisions of this section or the definition of an ADU as outlined in § 45-24-31, shall be void as against public policy. \n\n4.The following requirements apply to all ADUs.\n\n(i)An ADU shall have no more than two (2) bedrooms.\n\n(ii)The off-street parking requirement for an ADU shall be no more than one (1) space per bedroom.\n\n(iii)A studio or one-bedroom ADU may contain up to 900 sq. ft., or sixty percent (60%) of the floor area of the principal dwelling unit, whichever is less.

Visit:  https://countyofbexartx.portal.opengov.com/projectTemplate/2 to research information regarding your property and answer questions to determine the permits you will need.\n\nIn general, the process to follow for a signed PW Permit Verification in order to obtain a permit from the FMO is:\n\n1. Obtain City of San Antonio (COSA) documentation (from COSA Public Works Storm Water regarding storm water detention (application form must be stamped and dated by COSA staff along with any drainage report and stamped site plan reviewed by COSA) and a Certificate of Compliance in Military Protection Areas from COSA Development Services, if applicable).\n2. Submit Bexar County Permit Verification Form and supporting documents to Bexar County Public Works by clicking on the Select button above.\n3. Permit Verification (PV) Form signed by Bexar County Public Works (PW) once all items on the form have been confirmed\n4.

Certification and Food Service Permits.\n8. Permit Renewal and Maintenance.\n\nBefore or during the PW Permit Verification process, you may schedule an appointment to submit the building permit application and electronic plan files to the Fire Marshal Office (FMO) for their review and approval.   For more information, visit: https://www.bexar.org/643/Permits-Applications.\n\nThe building permit issuance in step 5 will not occur until the FMO receives a signed Permit Verification Form from Public Works.\n\nPhysical Locations and Contact Phone Numbers:\n\nCOSA Permits and Platting Location: 1901 S Alamo St San Antonio TX 78204 Contact: 210-207-1111\n\nBexar County Public Works and Environmental Services Permits\nLocation: 1948 Probandt San Antonio TX 78214 Contact: Luz Gonzales 210-335-0030\n\nBexar County Fire Marshal Code Compliance Office\nLocation:  9810 Southton Rd San Antonio TX 78223 Contact:  210-335-0300\n",

In consideration of the request, the administrator shall consider the following: \n1.  That the permit for the proposed temporary use would be consistent with the general intent of the zoning ordinance and comprehensive plan and would be permitted within the zoning district wherein located.\n2.  Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood or to the community in general, would not create a traffic hazard and would not harm the functioning of community facilities or services.\n\nA notice of the administrative review will be provided to abutting property owners, who will have seven days from the date of the mailing to respond with written comments for consideration. \n\nWritten notice of the decision will be provided to the applicant.

        "description": "This is an application for a Floodplain Development Permit.  Certain sections will be completed by you, the applicant, and certain sections will be completed by the local Floodplain Administrator (FPA).\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance to individuals at much lower premiums than could otherwise be purchased through private insurers, and makes certain federal monies available to local communities.  In order for citizens to be eligible for the national flood insurance rates, or for communities to receive certain kinds of federal monies, the community must agree to meet minimum floodplain standards.  This application is a tool to ensure that the minimum standards are met.\n\nIn a participating NFIP community, flood insurance polies can be purchased from any local insurance agent at the national rate.  Even though the policy may be issued as if it were coming from the insurance company you deal with, it is actually a Federal NFIP policy printed on the insurance agency's letterhead.  The rates are determined by the flood risk zone in which you live and by the elevation of the lowest floor of your home, not by the insurance company, and should be the same regardless of which agent or agency sells you the insurance. \n\nYou may buy flood insurance for your own peace of mind, you may be required to buy it before a lending institution will make or refinance a loan, or you may not be buying flood insurance at all.  Whatever the case, if the property which you propose to develop is located within a \"Special Flood Hazard Area\" on a flood map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you MUST obtain a Floodplain Development Permit prior to beginning the project.  This is a requirement of the local Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of your community, and there are penalties for failing to do so.\n\nFloodplain Development Permits are ONLY required for developments in areas designated as \"Special Flood Hazard Areas\" of FEMA-issued flood maps.  Flood maps can be reviewed at the office of your local FPA, or online at the FEMA website: www.MSC.FEMA.gov.\n\nIf you are proposing a development of any kind (constructing a new building, adding on to an existing building, clearing land, placing fill, grading land, mining, dredging, drilling, etc...) in a floodplain, you must submit this application for a Floodplain Development Permit to your local FPA.  Depending upon the type of development you are proposing, additional forms may be required.  For example, all new buildings in a Special Flood Hazard Area require an Elevation Certificate to document that the lowest floor of the building is elevated to a certain height relative to the anticipated flood crest of the \"base flood\" event.  The Elevation Certificate and other forms are provided in the Attachments section of this application, but should only be completed if they are required by the FPA for the proposed development. \n\nTypically, the Applicant completes the application form and submits the information to the local FPA.  The FPA reviews the submission and determines whether or not additional information is needed.  If it is, the FPA will request the additional information from the Applicant.  Once all required materials have been submitted, the FPA will make a permitting decision and either issue or deny the requested Floodplain Development Permit.\n\nThe Applicant should understand that a Floodplain Development Permit is only a permit to complete the proposed development.  It is a permit to, for example, build a house, construct a baseball field, install a drainage ditch or septic system, or grade a parcel of land.  Before the house can actually be occupied, or the developed land used, a Compliance Certificate must be issued by the local FPA.  The FPA will perform an inspection after the project is completed, or perhaps several inspections throughout the progress of the project, to ensure the development is complaint with the requirements of the local Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.  Once the Compliance Certificate has been issued, the process has been completed.",
