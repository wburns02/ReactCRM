The law requires that at least 20%-25% of units in a development have long-term affordability restrictions. Under Chapter 40B, the local Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is the permit granting authority. The ZBA must review and make decisions (approve, approve with conditions, or deny comprehensive permits) in a public hearing setting.\n\nA prerequisite to filing with the ZBA for a comprehensive permit is the issuance of a Project Eligibility Letter from a subsidizing agency.  The Sponsor has submitted an application for project eligibility to the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (the Subsidizing agency).",
