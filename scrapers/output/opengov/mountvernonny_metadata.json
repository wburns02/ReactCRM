To assist applicants when filing a Unified Solar Permit Application, we are sharing this checklist.  Note that requirements to qualify for review as a Unified Solar Permit application as noted on the USP applications remain in place and this checklist is only to be used as a guideline in addition to the application to aid the applicant by clearly detailing what our Plan Examiners will be looking for in the filing documents.  This checklist is unique to this City and was developed based on previous inadequate/incomplete USP applications filed since we launched the USP process in April 2024.\nThis City has the following challenges which has generated the need of these checklist to help mitigate issues due to the following:\n1.\\tAn older housing stock which has properties that might require:\na.\\tAdditional structural roof support that may be required for any additional dead load added to it.\nb.\\tRoofing materials and/or application that may need to be repaired or replaced to accommodate these types of installations.\nc.\\tOutdated and insufficient electrical power source and wiring which need to be upgraded to safely handle the requirements of these types of installations.\nd.\\tGenerally, the houses in this city were built in close adjacency to neighboring houses so there is more of a threat for the spread of a fire.\n2.\\tA history of a high rate of residential fires resulting in our fire department requiring the following:\na.\\tA clear and direct roof access path to the properties for firefighting.\nb.\\tRoofs that with this additional dead load added is still structurally capable of supporting the live load of firefighters/first responders when fighting fires.\nc.\\tUpgrading of electrical systems associated with these types of installations that can accommodate them safely.\nThe MV Building Department and Fire Department is supportive of the benefits to the environment and the energy savings of its residents installing solar panels and believes these guidelines will achieve this and at the same time if met they will keep our residents and our first responders safe.  \n\nPlease note:\n\nThe plans for this application will be reviewed by the third-party plans examiner company, Labella, and the Fire Department. Once both reviews are approved, a Building Department inspector will conduct an initial inspection to verify the site conditions.\n\nAfter the plans are approved and the initial inspection is passed, the permit will be issued.\n\nDo not begin any work before receiving the official permit and signed, approved plans from the Department of Buildings. Performing work without a permit will result in a Stop Work Order and a violation being issued.\n",
