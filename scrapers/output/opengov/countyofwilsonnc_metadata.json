Some water quality issues are easy to detect, while others are colorless, odorless and detectable only by lab analysis. To be sure your water is safe, it should be sampled and tested for contaminants periodically. Newly constructed wells are tested for bacteria and 17 inorganic parameters as a part of the well permit. Wilson County Environmental Health Services offers well water sampling and testing for existing wells to the citizens in the county. If you are experiencing water quality issues with your well water, or have safe drinking water concerns, contact Environmental Health Services to speak with a specialist.\n\nPlease allow two (2) business days for review of your sampling request.  You will be prompted for payment once the request has been approved.  Samples are sent to DHHS State Lab and can only be collected Monday through Wednesday before 4pm only.  Weeks that include a Holiday will vary. Bacteriological test results are generally returned within five (5) days. All other tests may take up to a minimum of four (4) weeks. Results are uploaded to this portal.",
