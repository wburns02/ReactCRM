Rezoning is not a formality; it is a change to the County’s law governing the use of private property. Members of the public, including the applicant, have the opportunity to comment on the request at the Planning Commission meeting, and at the 1st Council reading. Postcards are sent to property owners within 2000 feet of the subject parcel, notifying them of the proposed change and the meeting schedule. Notice of the proposed change will also appear in a newspaper of general circulation. A sign(s) will be posted on the property, identifying the property as under consideration for rezoning. The sign will be removed upon completion of the rezoning process.",
