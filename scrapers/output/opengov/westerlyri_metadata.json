If such ADU is part of an inclusionary zoning or comprehensive permit application, it may be restricted to affordable housing. See Section 260-50.\n\n2.Tenants of an ADU are not restricted based on familial relationships or age unless required by the terms of a federal, state, or municipal subsidy related to affordability.\n\n3.Private restrictions on ADUs imposed by condominium associations, homeowner associations, or similar residential property governing bodies, which conflict with the provisions of this section or the definition of an ADU as outlined in § 45-24-31, shall be void as against public policy. \n\n4.The following requirements apply to all ADUs.\n\n(i)An ADU shall have no more than two (2) bedrooms.\n\n(ii)The off-street parking requirement for an ADU shall be no more than one (1) space per bedroom.\n\n(iii)A studio or one-bedroom ADU may contain up to 900 sq. ft., or sixty percent (60%) of the floor area of the principal dwelling unit, whichever is less.

For this section, “floor area” shall be defined as heated above-ground living space.\n\n(v)Dimensional requirements applicable to any ADU shall be the same as any accessory or principal structure in the same zoning district. No additional lot area, lot frontage or lot width is required, for both conforming lots and legal nonconforming lots of record, solely to accommodate an ADU.\n\n(vi)ADUs shall not be offered or rented for tourist or transient use through a hosting platform, as such terms are defined in §42-63.1-2.\n",
