This plat should clearly indicate the street, alley, or easement to be vacated and include legal descriptions.\nThe petition for vacation requires signatures from all property owners that abut the area proposed for vacation.\nIf all abutting property owner signatures are not obtained, a Public Notice of Consideration to Vacate must be advertised in a local newspaper for four consecutive weeks. The petitioner is responsible for the advertising costs.\n\n2. City Review and Council Approval:\n\nThe Planning & Zoning Commission (PZC) will review the vacation plat and make a recommendation to City Council.\nCity Council will then consider legislation regarding the vacation, which requires three separate readings.\nA public meeting will be scheduled to allow anyone to address the Council regarding the proposed vacation.\n\n3. Utility Easements:\n\nIf a street, alley, or public highway is vacated or narrowed, affected railroads or public utilities may retain permanent easements for their facilities if the City determines relocation is unnecessary. This ensures the continued maintenance, operation, and access to these utilities.\n\n4. Plat Recording:\n\nFollowing City Council approval, the original tracing/mylar of the plat, along with three signed prints, will be returned to the petitioner.\nThe petitioner is then responsible for filing the approved vacation plat with the Summit County Recorder within 60 days.\nFailure to record the plat within this timeframe will result in the approval being voided.\n\n5. Final Submission:\n\nWithin five working days of recording the plat, the petitioner must furnish the Department of Planning & Zoning with the original tracing/mylar of the plat and a digital copy in a format acceptable to the City.",
