      "description": "This is an application for a Floodplain Development Permit.  Certain sections will be completed by you, the applicant, and certain sections will be completed by the local Floodplain Administrator (FPA).\n\nThe National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance to individuals at much lower premiums than could otherwise be purchased through private insurers, and makes certain federal monies available to local communities.  In order for citizens to be eligible for the national flood insurance rates, or for communities to receive certain kinds of federal monies, the community must agree to meet minimum floodplain standards.  This application is a tool to ensure that the minimum standards are met.\n\nIn a participating NFIP community, flood insurance polies can be purchased from any local insurance agent at the national rate.  Even though the policy may be issued as if it were coming from the insurance company you deal with, it is actually a Federal NFIP policy printed on the insurance agency's letterhead.  The rates are determined by the flood risk zone in which you live and by the elevation of the lowest floor of your home, not by the insurance company, and should be the same regardless of which agent or agency sells you the insurance. \n\nYou may buy flood insurance for your own peace of mind, you may be required to buy it before a lending institution will make or refinance a loan, or you may not be buying flood insurance at all.  Whatever the case, if the property which you propose to develop is located within a \"Special Flood Hazard Area\" on a flood map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), you MUST obtain a Floodplain Development Permit prior to beginning the project.  This is a requirement of the local Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of your community, and there are penalties for failing to do so.\n\nFloodplain Development Permits are ONLY required for developments in areas designated as \"Special Flood Hazard Areas\" of FEMA-issued flood maps.  Flood maps can be reviewed at the office of your local FPA, or online at the FEMA website: www.MSC.FEMA.gov.\n\nIf you are proposing a development of any kind (constructing a new building, adding on to an existing building, clearing land, placing fill, grading land, mining, dredging, drilling, etc...) in a floodplain, you must submit this application for a Floodplain Development Permit to your local FPA.  Depending upon the type of development you are proposing, additional forms may be required.  For example, all new buildings in a Special Flood Hazard Area require an Elevation Certificate to document that the lowest floor of the building is elevated to a certain height relative to the anticipated flood crest of the \"base flood\" event.  The Elevation Certificate and other forms are provided in the Attachments section of this application, but should only be completed if they are required by the FPA for the proposed development. \n\nTypically, the Applicant completes the application form and submits the information to the local FPA.  The FPA reviews the submission and determines whether or not additional information is needed.  If it is, the FPA will request the additional information from the Applicant.  Once all required materials have been submitted, the FPA will make a permitting decision and either issue or deny the requested Floodplain Development Permit.\n\nThe Applicant should understand that a Floodplain Development Permit is only a permit to complete the proposed development.  It is a permit to, for example, build a house, construct a baseball field, install a drainage ditch or septic system, or grade a parcel of land.  Before the house can actually be occupied, or the developed land used, a Compliance Certificate must be issued by the local FPA.  The FPA will perform an inspection after the project is completed, or perhaps several inspections throughout the progress of the project, to ensure the development is complaint with the requirements of the local Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance.  Once the Compliance Certificate has been issued, the process has been completed.",

      "description": "The purpose of a special use permit is to establish procedures for the review and approval of uses that are not permitted by right in a particular zoning district.  A special use permit is not transferable from one parcel of land to another nor shall it be considered as establishing a binding precedent to grant other special use permits.  Special use permits require a public hearing before the Planning and Zoning Commisssion following appropriate procedures.\n\nProcess of Completion and Public Hearing Schedule:\n1.  Applications will need to be deemed complete by the Planning Department prior to being scheduled for a public hearing. Once the applicant has been issued a completeness letter from the Planning Department verifying the application is complete, the application will be eligible to be scheduled at the next available Public Hearing.\n2.  Each Completeness Review Period is 2 weeks.\n3.  There is a 45-day cut-off window for a fully completed application (deemed complete) required prior to being scheduled for the next available Public Hearing.\nOnce we have 4 Public Hearings the applicants will be moved to the next month’s Hearing Date.",
