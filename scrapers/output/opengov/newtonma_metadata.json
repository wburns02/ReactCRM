They often are required when special site characteristics or design features warrant a deviation from the zoning standards for a typical lot. Common requests for exceptions to these standards include variations in building height, setbacks, floor area ratios (FARs), and the number of parking spaces provided. Sometimes a proposed use has unique characteristics that warrant special review to make sure it will be compatible with other uses nearby.",
