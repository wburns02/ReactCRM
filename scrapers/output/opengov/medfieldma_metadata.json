Because the plan does not create a “subdivision” under state law, the Planning Board’s role is limited to confirming that the lots have sufficient frontage and access, and the plan is endorsed as “Approval Not Required.” Applicants will need to file an ANR plan when dividing land in a way that complies with frontage and access requirements, without creating new roads or infrastructure that would otherwise trigger a full subdivision review.",

The ZBA reviews the project and may grant relief from local zoning or other requirements if needed to make the development feasible, while ensuring that health, safety, environmental, and design standards are met. A Comprehensive Permit is required when a developer seeks to build multifamily, mixed-income, or senior housing that does not fully comply with local zoning but qualifies under Chapter 40B. This process is intended to encourage the creation of affordable housing in communities where less than 10% of the housing stock is affordable.",
