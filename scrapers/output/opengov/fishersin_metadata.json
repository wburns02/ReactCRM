In addition, a parallel construction permit is required by the Departments of Planning and Permitting and Inspections for Decks, Pools/Spas, Building Additions, Screened-in Porches, and Accessory Structures or Sheds.  Please contact those Departments at 317-595-3120.  THIS PERMIT IS TO BE COMPLETED BY THE CONTRACTOR.           Permit Requirements:      1. Extent of easement encroachment:      a.  Minimum of 10 feet of easement width must be provided for storm sewer maintenance access and drainage flow behind easement construction.      b. If the drainage easement is shared by two properties behind or beside one another, at least 5 feet of easement or drainage swale width must be provided on each property.      c. The 10 feet easement access width minimum is intended for fences, small sheds, and minor landscaping that may be more easily removed if more width is required. Decks, patios, pool patios, etc. that are inherently more difficult to remove, may have a larger easement restriction requirement based on the case review and the overall easement width.      d. Decks cannot be attached to the home if they are permitted to encroach within the easement.      e. Decks, patios, etc. with proposed permanent roof structures cannot be attached to the home or have any supportive member of the roof structure within the drainage easement.           2. If storm pipe or drains exist within the easement, the 10 feet gap requirement should be divided equally with a 5 feet gap on both sides of the pipe/structure.          3. Existing condition of the swale/easement:  a. If existing encroachments prevent adequate maintenance access, the permitted encroachment may be more strictly limited to maintain the 10 feet easement width required for flow or maintenance.          4. Encroachments shall be allowed on the home side of the drainage easement so maintenance access and drainage flow is allowed behind the encroachment.          5. Willows or other water loving species of trees are strictly prohibited within any portion of the drainage easement if storm sewers exist nearby due to their aggressive nature and ability to damage and obstruct storm sewers .         6. Fences or other improvements shall not cross-cut the swale perpendicular to the swale flow line (regardless of open or closed panel fence types, removability of panels, or gate options)          7. Swale grading or other tile installations to improve drainage within the easement must restore grade to the original flow line grade or to a steeper, improved flow line grade.",
