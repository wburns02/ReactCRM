## Executive Summary

The customer success landscape in 2025-2026 has undergone significant transformation, driven by AI integration, outcome-focused methodologies, and the rise of digital-first engagement models. This research analyzes the five leading customer success platforms (Gainsight, ChurnZero, Totango, Planhat, and Vitally) and identifies key industry trends that will shape customer success strategy.

### Key Findings

1. **AI Integration is Now Table Stakes**: Every major CSP has embedded AI for health scoring, churn prediction, and task automation. Gartner projects AI will reduce contact center labor costs by $80 billion by 2026.

2. **Outcome-Driven Metrics are Replacing Activity Metrics**: NPS is being superseded by adoption-focused metrics like Time-to-Value and Outcome Success Rate. Companies are shifting from tracking "how often" to "why" customers engage.

3. **Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is the Defining Metric**: Companies with high NRR grow 2.5x faster. Top SaaS companies achieve NRR above 120%, with elite performers exceeding 150%.

4. **Digital CS at Scale is Maturing**: Tech-touch and low-touch models powered by AI enable personalized engagement without proportional headcount increases. BCG estimates 30-50% productivity gains.

5. **Journey Orchestration Market Exploding**: Projected growth from $12.5B (2025) to $86.8B (2034), with organizations reporting 10-20% revenue gains and 15-25% cost reductions.
