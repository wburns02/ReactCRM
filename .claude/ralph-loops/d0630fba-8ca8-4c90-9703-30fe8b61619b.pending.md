Plan to knock out in the order: Performance, Code Quality, Security, features/debt. Test after each phase. Resolve issues as you find them.

## Phase A: Performance
1. Add slow query logging to backend
2. Add Redis caching on hot API paths (dashboard stats, customer list)
3. Optimize frontend bundle (analyze chunks, lazy-load heavy routes)

## Phase B: Code Quality
1. Add more unit tests (target: 30+ test files)
2. Add PageObject pattern to key E2E tests

## Phase C: Security
1. Add password complexity requirements
2. Bump backend version to 3.1.0
3. Run migration 071 on production

## Phase D: Features/Debt
1. Clean up deprecated code paths
2. Fix any issues found during testing
